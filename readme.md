# WIP - BIBD Web App

## Introduction
This laravel web application was done to play around and test the idea of creating a web application that utilizes the existing BIBD Mobile Webservices. On top of that it is also to see the possibilities of extending the features to include:
1) P2P QR Payment for consumer to consumer, instead of just consumer to merchant.
2) Scheduling auto payments or creating standing instructions.
3) A more persistent login
4) And more..

Anyway, if you're interested in BIBD's Webservices, check the BIBDController (`/app/Http/Controllers/BIBDController.php`). You should see how it's implemented in there.

## Installing & Configuration

If you want to run this on your own laptop, use Laragon (assuming you're on windows) or Valet (if you are on Mac), steps are:

1. Copy/Clone this project into the web directory.
2. Create a database called mybibd.
3. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Then change these variables accordingly (your bibd creds). Note: `PASSWORD` and `INTERNET_PIN` values should not be the same and modify the database (`DB_`) according to your environment setup.
   
   **Make sure you enter your password/pin correctly to prevent getting locked out. If you do get locked out, call BIBD's hotline for help on resetting it.**

    ```
    DB_DATABASE=mybibd
    ...
    USERNAME=null <-- Your BIBD Login ID
    PASSWORD=null <-- A random password to login to this web app
    INTERNET_PIN=null <-- Your BIBD internet pin
    MOBILE_PIN=null <-- Your BIBD mobile pin
    ```


5. Run `composer install`
6. Run `npm install`
7. Run `php artisan key:generate`
8. Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`
9.  Done, just go to http://mybibd.test in your web browser and login using your creds.

## Installing & Configuration The Docker Way :whale:

Must have Docker and docker-compose installed. This method uses [Laradock](https://laradock.io/getting-started/#Usage) as follows:

1. Copy/Clone/Download this project repo.
2. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Then change these variables accordingly (your bibd creds). Note: `PASSWORD` and `INTERNET_PIN` values should not be the same and modify the database (`DB_`) according to your environment setup.
   
   **Make sure you enter your password/pin correctly to prevent getting locked out. If you do get locked out, call BIBD's hotline for help on resetting it.**

    ```
    DB_DATABASE=mybibd
    ...
    USERNAME=null <-- Your BIBD Login ID
    PASSWORD=null <-- A random password to login to this web app
    INTERNET_PIN=null <-- Your BIBD internet pin
    MOBILE_PIN=null <-- Your BIBD mobile pin
    ```

4. Enter the laradock folder and copy `env-example` to `.env`

`cd laradock`
`cp env-example .env`

You can edit the `.env` file to choose which software’s you want to be installed in your environment. You can always refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file to see how those variables are being used.

Depending on the host’s operating system you may need to change the value given to `COMPOSE_FILE`. When you are running Laradock on Mac OS the correct file separator to use is `:`. When running Laradock from a Windows environment multiple files must be separated with `;`.

By default the containers that will be created have the current directory name as suffix (e.g. `mybibd_workspace_1`). This can cause mixture of data inside the container volumes if you use laradock in multiple projects. In this case, either read the guide for [multiple projects](https://laradock.io/getting-started/#B) or change the variable `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to something unique like your project name.

*Note: Sometimes the `.env` file is changed/edited doesn't get reflected into the container, and if that happens, you have to rebuild the containers. `docker-compose down`, `docker-compose up -d nginx mysql`, then redo from step 6*

5. Build the environment and run it using `docker-compose`

In this example we’ll see how to run NGINX (web server) and MySQL (database engine) to host a PHP Web Scripts:

`docker-compose up -d nginx mysql`

Note: All the web server containers `nginx`, `apache` ..etc depends on `php-fpm`, which means if you run any of them, they will automatically launch the `php-fpm` container for you, so no need to explicitly specify it in the up command. If you have to do so, you may need to run them as follows: `docker-compose up -d nginx php-fpm mysql`.

You can select your own combination of containers from [this list](https://laradock.io/introduction/#supported-software-images).

(Please note that sometimes we forget to update the docs, so check the `docker-compose.yml` file to see an updated list of all available containers).

6. Enter the Workspace container

`docker-compose exec workspace bash`

*Alternatively, for Windows PowerShell users: execute the following command to enter any running container:*

`docker exec -it {workspace-container-id} bash`

Note: You can add `--user=laradock` to have files created as your host’s user. Example:

`docker-compose exec --user=laradock workspace bash`

*You can change the PUID (User id) and PGID (group id) variables from the `.env` file)*

7. Execute commands

Run `composer install && npm install && php artisan key:generate && php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

8. Open your browser and visit your localhost address.
